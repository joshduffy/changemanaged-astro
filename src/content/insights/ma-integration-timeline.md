The deal team handed us a 147-page playbook once. Color-coded workstreams. Detailed Gantt charts. Synergy targets by quarter.

It was beautiful.

It was also useless within six weeks.

The acquired company's finance system was more fragile than due diligence revealed. A key leader took another offer three weeks in. A customer we assumed was locked up started shopping competitors the day the deal was announced.

The plan is not the work. The plan is a starting point. The work is what you do when the plan meets reality—and reality wins, as it always does.

## The 100-day myth

Everyone talks about the first 100 days. McKinsey has frameworks for it. Bain has frameworks for it. Every integration playbook has a 100-day section.

Here's what they don't tell you: the 100-day obsession often backfires.

Teams rush to hit arbitrary milestones. Quick wins get prioritized over foundational work. Leaders declare victory before the hard stuff is done. Then month four hits and everything unravels because the integration was built on sand.

The deals that succeed aren't the ones that move fastest. They're the ones that sequence correctly. Foundation first, acceleration second. You can't rush trust. You can't shortcut culture. You can't skip the unglamorous work of actually integrating systems, processes, and people.

## What actually matters

After dozens of integrations, here's what I've learned actually drives outcomes:

**Clear accountability from Day 1.** Not a 200-person steering committee. Not matrixed responsibility across workstreams. One person owns each major decision. One person is accountable for each synergy target. One person drives each integration milestone. The names are public. The expectations are clear.

**Short feedback loops.** Weekly integration meetings where problems surface fast. Not monthly executive reviews where bad news gets filtered. The integration team needs to know within days—not weeks—when something isn't working. The earlier you catch problems, the cheaper they are to fix.

**Leadership willing to adapt.** The plan will be wrong. Parts of the thesis won't hold. Assumptions will prove false. The question is whether leadership acknowledges this and adjusts, or whether they keep executing a broken plan because changing would feel like failure.

## The real timeline

Forget the 100-day plan. Here's how integrations actually unfold:

**Pre-close (Day -90 to Day 0):** Planning under constraints. You can't talk to their people. You can't access their systems. You're making decisions with incomplete information. The goal is to be ready for Day 1, not to have everything figured out.

**Day 0-30: Stabilize.** Don't break anything. Payroll runs. Customers get served. Systems stay up. Employees know who their boss is. This sounds basic but it's where many integrations fail. The first 30 days should feel unremarkable. Remarkable is bad.

**Day 30-90: Organize.** Now you can actually see what you bought. Assess the people. Understand the systems. Validate the synergies. This is when the thesis meets reality. Adjust the plan based on what you learn.

**Day 90-180: Integrate.** Start combining things. Consolidate systems. Align processes. Make the hard calls about overlapping roles. This is where the work gets difficult and where most synergies are actually captured.

**Day 180-365: Optimize.** The major integration is done. Now you're tuning. Capturing the remaining synergies. Building the combined culture. Addressing the integration debt you accumulated.

**Year 2 and beyond:** Sustain. Integration isn't a project that ends. It's a transition to normal operations. The question is whether you've built something sustainable or just papered over problems that will resurface.

## The synergy trap

Deals get sold on synergy projections. Revenue synergies. Cost synergies. Operational synergies. The numbers look compelling in the board deck.

Then reality hits.

Revenue synergies almost never materialize as projected. The cross-sell opportunity assumes customers will buy from a combined company they don't yet trust. The pricing power assumes competitors won't respond. The market expansion assumes capabilities that don't exist yet.

Cost synergies are more achievable but take longer than projected. Headcount reductions require severance and transition time. System consolidations require migration projects. Real estate optimization requires lease negotiations.

The integrations that succeed are honest about this. They discount revenue synergies heavily. They pad cost synergy timelines. They build contingency into the model. And they track actuals against projections obsessively, adjusting when reality diverges from plan.

## Culture is the hardest part

Every integration guide talks about culture. Few integrations actually address it.

Culture isn't a workstream you can delegate to HR. It's not fixed with town halls and values posters. It's how decisions actually get made. How information actually flows. How conflict actually gets resolved. How success actually gets rewarded.

When two companies combine, you're combining two cultures. Sometimes they're compatible. Often they're not. The question is whether you acknowledge this and actively shape the combined culture, or whether you let it evolve randomly and hope for the best.

The integrations that fail on culture usually fail on one of two things: either they ignore culture entirely (assuming it will "work itself out"), or they impose one culture on the other without earning buy-in. Both approaches generate resistance, resentment, and regrettable attrition.

Better approach: be explicit about the target culture. Identify where the two organizations differ. Make deliberate choices about which norms to keep, which to adopt, and which to create new. Then invest in actually shifting behavior—not through posters, but through systems, incentives, and leadership modeling.
