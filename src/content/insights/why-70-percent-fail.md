I once walked into a program launch where twelve teams each had their own roadmap. Nobody agreed on what "done" looked like. Everyone was busy. Nothing was changing.

Whether the exact failure rate is 70% or 57% matters less than the pattern: transformations fail for the same human reasons, repeatedly. Here's how we run them differently.

## Establish a Clear Purpose Statement

Before anything else, answer this: what is the one sentence that describes success? A director should be able to say it without looking at notes.

- Is value coming from revenue, cost, or risk reduction?
- That statement governs every governance discussion
- Every status update connects back to it
- Work that doesn't serve it gets moved to "later"

Focus is a resource. Spend it deliberately.

## Enable Leadership Execution

Sponsorship isn't a name on the first slide. It's visible, consistent, and operational.

Real sponsorship looks like:
- Decisions returned within 48 hours, not weeks
- Leaders showing up to working sessions, not just steering committees
- Willingness to stop work that isn't delivering

When leadership is consistent, resistance fades. People stop waiting to see which way the wind blows because the direction is clear.

## Design Achievable Implementation Work

Go-live is not success. Adoption is.

The difference between systems that get used and systems that get worked around comes down to how you design the change:

- Map what changes for each role, not just which buttons to click
- Build training around realistic scenarios, not feature tours
- Equip managers to coach, not just forward emails

Leading indicators matter: Are people using it consistently? Are they getting better at it? Has the grumbling stabilized?

## Implement Transparent Governance

Governance should be boring. That's the goal.

- One place for documentation
- One cadence for reporting
- One log for decisions
- No shadow decision-making
- No surprises in status updates
- Finance at the table, so conversations stay grounded in value

When everyone sees the same picture, energy goes toward solving problems instead of debating what the problems are.
