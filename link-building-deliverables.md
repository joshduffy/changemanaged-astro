### Post 1: Why 70% of Transformations Fail

```
The famous "70% of transformations fail" stat gets cited everywhere.

Whether the exact number is 70% or 57% matters less than the pattern: they fail for the same human reasons, repeatedly.

After running dozens of enterprise transformations, I've found the failures cluster around four themes:

→ Unclear purpose (what does "done" look like?)
→ Wrong metrics (vanity measures vs. value drivers)
→ Delayed decisions (analysis paralysis kills momentum)
→ Invisible friction (process gaps that nobody owns)

The good news: these are fixable. But you have to see them first.

### Post 2: The First 100 Days Framework

```
The "first 100 days" of a merger integration is both critical and wildly overemphasized.

Here's the truth: Day 100 is not a finish line. It's a milestone.

But what you do in those 100 days sets the trajectory for everything that follows.

We structure it in three phases:

Days 1-30: Maintain stakeholder confidence
→ Reliable communication beats comprehensive communication
→ Close information gaps before customers and employees fill them with rumors

Days 31-60: Define the operating model
→ Organizational design isn't about boxes—it's about who decides what
→ Move fast enough that good people don't leave while waiting

Days 61-100: Execute and stabilize
→ First wave of synergies realized
→ Systems and processes operating (or clear timeline if not)
→ 100-day report demonstrates progress toward the thesis

The biggest mistake I see: treating integration like a project with an end date.

Integration is a capability, not an event.

### Post 3: PROSCI - What Certification Doesn't Teach

```
I've been PROSCI certified since 2012. I believe in the framework.

But here's what I've learned: the distance between "certified" and "effective" is vast.

Three things experience taught me that certification didn't:

1. Most sponsors don't know how to sponsor
→ They sign charters but never walk the floor
→ They delegate when they should be visible
→ Coaching them is half the job

2. Resistance is often a symptom, not a cause
→ "People don't like change" is lazy diagnosis
→ Usually they don't like uncertainty, broken processes, or being ignored
→ Address the root cause, not the behavior

3. The best change networks are volunteers, not appointees
→ Enthusiasm beats org chart position
→ Informal influence matters more than title
→ Find the people others already listen to

The framework is the starting point. The craft is knowing where it bends.
